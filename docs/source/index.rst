Thanks
======

This project is heavily based on a couple of really great libraries, particularly ``django-storages`` and ``django-cloud-tasks``.
See `our attributions page <https://github.com/octue/django-gcp/blob/main/ATTIBUTIONS.md>`_.

Thank you so much to the (many) authors of these libraries :)

Also, this library boilerplate is from the ``django-rabid-armadillo`` project...
